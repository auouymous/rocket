Minetest Rocket
==========

Using a rocket propels player in look direction.
Using a rocket while sneaking launches a rocket in look direction which explodes on impact or after 2 seconds.
Exploding rockets deal minor area damage and spawn colored particles.

Rockets can be launched from a pipeworks node breaker.

`rocket_boost = 0` disables rocket riding, non-zero values is the velocity added to player (default: 50).
Boost values less than 30 aren't very useful.

`rocket_require_blueprint = true` adds an uncraftable blueprint that is required to craft rockets.
